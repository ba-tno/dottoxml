## Fork modifications
- Rewrote all Python 2 command such that they work in Python 3
- Hardoced input file encoding to UTF-8 (as I don't understand how to rewrite the `unicode` function to Python 3)
- Changed default arrowheads from `none` to `normal`.

## Modified version of dottoxml 

Protégé includes the OntoGraf plugin that allows to create a visual graph display from an ontology and to export that display as a `.dot` format file.

`dottoxml` converts [GraphWiz](http://www.graphviz.org) `.dot` files to `.graphml` files that can be read by [yEd](http://www.yworks.com/products/yed#).

yEd provides reasonable features for cleaning up the graphical display which is tedious and intractable for large graphs in OntoGraf.

The modifications made to dottoxml include:

 - setting arrowheads on the target end of edges; 
 - setting the shape of nodes to ellipse rather than rectangle; 
 - deleting a useless comment about domain and range on edge labels that OntoGraf seems to insert when generating the edge labels from property names; and 
 - setting the edge style to smooth Bezier rather than PolyLine

Running the dottoxml is done via:

    python dottoxml input-file.dot output-file.graphml

Then open the graphml file in yEd and then select `Tools >> Fit Node to Label` followed by selecting an automatic layout via the `Layout` menu -- the `One-click Layout` works decently.
